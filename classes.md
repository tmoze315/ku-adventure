# Classes

**Wizard**

Wizard is a clever magic user. Intelligence and Luck affects this class's cooldown and damage **spells**.

Put all your skill points into Intelligence. When battling, use the ‚ú® \(spell\)  reaction.

**\[**Use command `-focus` to boost spell attempt**\]**

**Bard**

Bards are our wandering minstrels that may or may not get it on with monsters.

Charisma and diplomacy directly affects this class's cooldown and **persuasion** **\(talk\)** attempts.

Put all your skill points into Charisma. When battling, use the üó£ \(talk\) reaction.

**\[**Use command `-music` to boost talk attempt**\]**

**Ranger**

Rangers have pets that boost their rewards from victories, such as **increased currency drop and increased XP**. There is also a small chance that your pet will do extra damage during a battle.

Getting the most out of this class is a little trickier than the others. When you are battling, you want to either choose high attack and üó° \(stab\) or high intelligence and ‚ú® \(spell\). It doesn't matter which one you choose - just pick the one that gives you the most damage based on your gear.

When you are looking at capturing a pet, you want to have high charisma, as this increases your chances of getting a stronger pet \(which gets you better loot\). So, before pet hunting, change your equipment to give you high charisma then swap back to your battle equipment after you have a pet. Note: you can use `-loadout` to make it easy to swap between item sets.

**\[**Use command `-pet` to attempt to tame a random animal**\]**  
**\[**Can also use command `-pet forage`  to send your pet out in search of an item!**\]** 

**Berserker**

This is your basic fighter. Attack, Luck and Dexterity directly affect this characters **damage \(fight\)** abilities. **\[**Use command `-rage` to boost attack attempt**\]**

**Cleric**

Cleric is a cheerleader that can pray to boost everyone else's attacking or talking abilities. Intelligence and Luck affects this class's cooldown and **prayers**.

There's a balance to be struck when battling with this player. If there are less than 4-5 people participating in a battle, you will probably do more damage by attacking \(‚ú®\) instead of praying \(üôè\). Clerics become more powerful the more people participate in a fight.

Put all your skills into Intelligence.

**\[**Use command `-bless` to boost prayer attempt**\]**

**Tinkerer**

Tinkerers can make new items from two pieces of gear, by forging them together. They can use any 2 items in their backpack, regardless of item level. You will forge stronger items by using high level/stat items.

You can only have 1 forged item at a time. Forging a 2nd item will destroy the 1st. Your forged item is destroyed if you change class and you cannot trade it with other players. All forged items can be equipped at level 1.

This is a great class for newer players as it lets you benefit from high level Legendary items that you otherwise would not be able to equip.

Intelligence and Luck affects forged items.  
**\[**Use command `-forge` to combine two items into one unique item that binds to you and cannot be traded.**\]**
