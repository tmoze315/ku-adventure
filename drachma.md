# Gold

## Gold

Gold is the in-game currency. It is used in order to:

* Repair your gear after a lost battle.
* Rebirth.
* Use the Negaverse to level up.

**There are 3 ways in which you can earn more gold:**

* Winning battles. The harder the enemy, the more gold you will get.
* Using the `-apayday` and `-payday` commands in `#adv-town` to get +500 gold each command**.** **You can use these once every 2 hours.**
* Selling your equipment.

During Rebirth and Negaverse actions, you will lose a portion \(if not all\) of your gold. You can store your gold as Drachma \(to save it from being lost\) by using the command `-atransfer withdraw 500000` and replacing the 500,000 for however much gold you want to convert. The minimum is 500,000, and remember not to put any commas in the command. 

There is a tax of 9% on the gold you convert to Drachma, so you do lose some of it. Drachma has a conversion rate of 1 to 10, so for every 10 gold you have, you \*could\* have one Drachma. When you are ready to convert it back to gold, use the command `-atransfer deposit 1000` replacing the 1,000 with the amount of Drachma you want converted.
