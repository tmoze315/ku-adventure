# Negaverse \(Risk gold for XP\)

## Negaverse \(Risk gold for XP\)

Negaverse allows you to spend your hard-earned gold to boost your xp, quickly giving you levels! The more gold you spend at once, the more xp you gain \(up to a limit\) and the higher percentage of your total gold balance you spend, the better your odds of winning are. There are some complex formulae involved here, but the simplest way to negaverse optimally is to use the [calculator](https://codepen.io/tmoze315/full/xxZyPqx) below.

## How to Negaverse Optimally

[https://codepen.io/tmoze315/full/xxZyPqx](https://codepen.io/tmoze315/full/xxZyPqx)

* Use the [calculator](https://codepen.io/tmoze315/full/xxZyPqx) to find the amount you should be spending at a time
* Find someone to help you bank with
* Transfer the amount given on the top right of the calculator \("Amount to transfer away"\) to your helper
* Negaverse your full balance `-negaverse <amount>` or `-nv <amount>`
* If you fail, have your helper transfer your negaverse amount back to you and click the + button on the calculator. Then repeat until you succeed!
* Once you succeed, have your helper transfer the rest of your gold back to you \("Amount that gets transferred back to you"\)
* Be careful to not use more than the amount you initially transferred!
* Once you've succeeded, there is a 1 hour cooldown before you can try again
